# Business Problem

It is desired to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified. You are expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps before developing the model.

# Dataset Story

The dataset is part of the large dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the USA. Data used for diabetes research on Pima Indian women aged 21 and over living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city of the State of Arizona in the USA.
The target variable is specified as "outcome"; 1 indicates positive diabetes test result, 0 indicates negative.

In this project, using the diabetes dataset, I turned the feature engineering step, which is the final step before building the model that will predict whether a person has diabetes in the light of the variables we have, into a project. With the scripts I created, I easily identified the null and outliers in the data set, revealed the numerical, categorical and cardinal variables, suppressed the outlier values with their thresholds, and completed the data preprocessing stage by examining the correlation map.

Within the scope of this project, I made feature extraction, which is one of the methods to increase model success, and I derived new variables from the variables I had and analyzed the importance levels of these variables in the latest plot importance function.
